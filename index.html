      <h2>What Is a Credit Card FAQ Hub?</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card FAQ hub is a structured place where common questions are grouped and explained without sales language. Instead of reading long marketing pages, you get short answers to the issues that normally send people to customer support: unexpected fees, pending transactions, declined payments and confusing rewards rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is not tied to any single bank or issuer. The aim is to focus on how typical credit card features behave in practice, using wording you might find on network documentation and cardholder agreements rather than promotional campaigns.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Credit Cards Work Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        When you pay with a credit card, you are effectively drawing on a revolving line of credit. The issuer settles the transaction with the merchant now, then bills you later on your statement date. If you pay the full balance by the due date, you usually avoid interest; if not, interest accrues on the carried balance according to the card’s APR rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the background, multiple actors are involved: the merchant, their acquiring bank, the card network and your issuer. Authorisations, reversals, refunds and chargebacks all move between these parties according to network rules, which explains why some actions show up instantly in your app while others take days to finalise.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Questions About Interest, Fees and Limits</h2>
      <p>
        Cardholders often ask why interest appears even after a payment, or why a balance is higher than expected. The usual reasons include partial payments, cash advances, or purchases made after the statement date but before the due date. Each scenario can be treated differently in the issuer’s interest calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Questions about limits are equally frequent. Total credit limit, available credit and cash-advance limit are related but not identical. Temporary holds on hotels, fuel or car rentals can reserve part of your limit, which may look like “missing” funds until the final amount settles and the hold is released.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards, Cash Back and Points – FAQ View</h2>
      <p>
        Rewards programmes generate many small questions: why one purchase earned fewer points, why a bonus did not post yet, or what happens to points when an item is returned. The answers usually depend on timing rules, category coding and minimum spend requirements defined in the card’s reward terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also common to ask whether rewards expire, how statement credits compare to travel redemptions, and what happens if you close the card. FAQ-style explanations help you connect the marketing headline, such as “3x on travel”, with the underlying rules that govern how and when value is actually delivered.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Security, Disputes and Protections</h2>
      <p>
        When something goes wrong — an unrecognised charge, a card lost abroad, or a merchant that never delivered — cardholders want to know what protections they have. Basic protections are defined by network and regulation, while extra coverage may be included as a card benefit or purchased as insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAQs in this area often cover how to lock a card, when to report a transaction as fraud, how provisional credits work and what information you need when raising a dispute. Understanding these steps in advance makes it easier to react quickly if something looks off on your statement.
