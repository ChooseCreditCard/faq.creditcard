    <!-- Basics -->
    <section id="basics" class="section">
      <h2>How Does a Credit Card Actually Work?</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card is short-term credit from a lender. You are given a credit limit and can make purchases
        up to that limit. Once per month, the issuer sends a statement showing what you spent, what you owe,
        and the minimum payment due.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you pay the full statement balance by the due date, you typically avoid interest on purchases.
        If you carry a balance, interest is charged at the card’s APR (Annual Percentage Rate), which can be high
        compared with other types of loans.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Limit:</strong> maximum the bank allows you to owe at one time.</li>
        <li><strong>Statement balance:</strong> what you owed at the end of the billing cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum payment:</strong> small amount required to avoid late fees – not a recommendation.</li>
        <li><strong>Grace period:</strong> time between statement date and due date where purchases may be interest-free if paid in full.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small mt-3">
        For a deeper breakdown of mechanics, see the
        <a href="https://choose.creditcard/guides/apr-basics/?utm_source=faq.creditcard&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=link_apr_basics">
          APR basics guide
        </a>
        on Choose.Creditcard.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees & APR -->
    <section id="fees" class="section">
      <h2>What Fees Should I Really Care About?</h2>
      <p>
        Cards can come with a long list of potential fees. In practice, a few matter the most for day-to-day use:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Annual fee:</strong> what you pay each year just to hold the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign transaction / FX fee:</strong> a percentage added when you pay in a foreign currency.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest (APR):</strong> cost of carrying a balance past the due date.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash advance fees:</strong> extra cost for withdrawing cash or cash-like transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Late payment fees:</strong> charged if you miss the due date.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        “No annual fee” does not automatically mean “cheap” if FX fees and interest are high. Likewise, a card with a
        fee can be worth it if travel benefits or insurance are genuinely valuable for your pattern.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="apr" class="section">
      <h2>What Is APR and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It expresses the yearly cost of borrowing if you carry a balance,
        including interest and certain mandatory charges. With credit cards, APR is often much higher than on
        personal loans or mortgages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you always pay the full statement balance on time, APR may matter less. If you sometimes carry a balance,
        a high APR can make borrowing very expensive, very quickly.
      </p>

        </a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Travel & FX -->
    <section id="travel" class="section">
      <h2>Which Card Is Best for Travel & Foreign Currency?</h2>
      <p>
        For travel, three factors usually matter more than small differences in points:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>FX fees:</strong> 0% FX is ideal if you often pay in foreign currencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> medical, delay, baggage and rental car coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Lounge access & perks:</strong> useful if you travel frequently or on long routes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        A “travel card” with high FX fees can destroy the value of rewards. Likewise, insurance is only useful if it
        matches how you actually travel and if you meet the conditions (for example “must pay at least 50% of the trip with the card”).
      </p>
      <p class="small mt-3">

    </section>

    <!-- Credit score -->
    <section id="score" class="section">
      <h2>How Does a Credit Card Affect My Credit Score?</h2>
      <p>
        Most scoring models look at similar building blocks. A card can influence:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Payment history:</strong> paying on time is one of the most important factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> the ratio of balance to credit limit – lower is usually better.</li>
        <li><strong>Account age:</strong> keeping older accounts open can help average age.</li>
        <li><strong>New credit:</strong> many applications in a short time can temporarily hurt a score.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix of credit:</strong> having only cards vs a mix of loans can matter in some models.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Used carefully, a card can help build or rebuild credit. Used poorly, with missed payments or high utilization,
        it can damage a score and make future borrowing more expensive.

    </section>

    <!-- Rewards -->
    <section id="rewards" class="section">
      <h2>Points vs Cashback – Which Is Better?</h2>
      <p>
        Neither is universally better. It depends on how you spend and redeem:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Cashback:</strong> simple, predictable and usually easier to value.</li>
        <li><strong>Points / miles:</strong> can be more valuable per unit if used for premium travel, but more complex.</li>
        <li><strong>Loyalty points:</strong> tied to a specific airline or hotel – great if you are loyal, less flexible otherwise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        If you rarely travel, simple cashback can be more useful than miles you never use. If you fly often and are willing
        to learn loyalty programs, points and miles can give outsized value on certain redemptions.

    <!-- Protections & safety -->
    <section id="protections" class="section">
      <h2>What Insurance and Protections Do Cards Provide?</h2>
      <p>
        Many cards include some form of protection, for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li>Travel insurance (medical, delays, baggage) when paying for trips.</li>
        <li>Purchase protection and extended warranty on eligible items.</li>
        <li>Chargeback rights if something goes wrong with a purchase.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Coverage details vary a lot between issuers and countries. The only reliable source is the official policy document.
        Marketing pages often highlight limits but not exclusions and conditions, so always read the insurance terms themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="small mt-3">

    <section id="safety" class="section">
      <h2>How Do I Use a Card Safely Online and Abroad?</h2>
      <p>
        Basic safety practices reduce risk significantly:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li>Enable notifications for all transactions.</li>
        <li>Use virtual cards or one-time numbers where available.</li>
        <li>Avoid saving card details on random sites – use trusted wallets instead.</li>
        <li>Report lost or stolen cards immediately and monitor statements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Many modern cards also support tokenization (via wallets) and additional security layers like 3-D Secure.
        These can help reduce the impact of compromised card details.
      </p>
      <p class="small mt-3">

    <section id="next-steps" class="section">
      <h2>What Should I Do Before Applying for a Card?</h2>
      <p>
        Before sending an application, it can help to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li>Clarify your main goal (travel, FX, cashback, rebuilding credit, business, etc.).</li>
        <li>Check your current credit situation and obligations.</li>
        <li>Read at least one guide related to your goal (travel, score, protections, etc.).</li>
        <li>Compare a few cards with the same use-case, not random offers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
